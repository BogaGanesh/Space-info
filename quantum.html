<h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>
<p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This connection persists even if the particles are separated by vast distances, seemingly defying classical notions of locality and causality.</p><br>

<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>Quantum entanglement emerged from the development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The concept was first explicitly discussed in a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR), who used it to argue that quantum mechanics was incomplete. They proposed the EPR paradox, suggesting that quantum mechanics allowed for "spooky action at a distance," which they believed violated the principle of locality.</p>
<p>Physicist John Stewart Bell formulated Bell's theorem, which provided a way to test whether the correlations between entangled particles could be explained by classical physics or required a quantum explanation.</p>
<p>Bell's inequalities set limits on the correlations predicted by classical theories. Quantum mechanics predicts violations of these inequalities, which have been confirmed experimentally.</p><br>

<h3>Theoretical Foundations</h3>
<p>Entanglement relies on the principle of superposition, where a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.</p>
<p>For example, two entangled particles can be in a superposition of states like 
∣
0
⟩
∣0⟩ and 
∣
1
⟩
∣1⟩, described by a combined wavefunction.</p>
<p>The wavefunction of an entangled system cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle</p>
<p>When one particle is measured, the wavefunction collapses instantaneously, determining the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them.</p>
<p>This instantaneous correlation is what Einstein famously called "spooky action at a distance."</p><br>

<h3>Experimental Evidence</h3>
<p>French physicist Alain Aspect conducted groundbreaking experiments in the 1980s that demonstrated violations of Bell's inequalities, confirming the predictions of quantum mechanics over classical theories.</p>
<p>These experiments used entangled photons and measured their polarization states, showing that the correlations between them could not be explained by any local hidden variable theory.</p>
<p>In 2017, Chinese scientists used the Micius satellite to distribute entangled photons over 1,200 kilometers, setting a record for the longest distance over which entanglement has been observed.</p>
<p>While entanglement is often discussed in the context of small particles like photons or electrons, it has also been demonstrated in larger systems, such as superconducting qubits and even tiny diamonds.</p><br>

<h3>Applications of Quantum Entanglement</h3>
<p>Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum computing, enabling quantum parallelism and quantum gates that operate on multiple states simultaneously.</p>
<p>Algorithms like Shor's algorithm (for factoring large numbers) and Grover's algorithm (for searching unsorted databases) rely on entanglement for their speedup over classical algorithms.</p>
<p>Entanglement enables quantum key distribution (QKD), a method for secure communication. Protocols like BB84 and E91 use entangled particles to generate cryptographic keys that are immune to eavesdropping.</p>
<p>Quantum teleportation uses entanglement to transfer the quantum state of one particle to another distant particle without physically transmitting the particle itself.</p>
<p>This has been experimentally demonstrated with photons, atoms, and even small molecules.</p>
<p>Entanglement is the foundation of future quantum networks, which aim to connect quantum computers and devices over long distances, enabling secure communication and distributed quantum computing.</p><br>

<h3>Challenges and Open Questions</h3>
<p>Entangled states are highly sensitive to interactions with their environment, leading to decoherence, which destroys the entanglement.</p>
<p>Overcoming decoherence is a major challenge in building practical quantum technologies.</p>
<p>Scaling up entangled systems (e.g., for quantum computers) requires maintaining entanglement across many particles, which is technically demanding.</p>
<p>How does entanglement relate to spacetime and gravity? Some theories, like quantum gravity, suggest a deep connection between entanglement and the fabric of spacetime.</p>
<p>What is the true nature of entanglement? Is it a fundamental feature of the universe, or is there a deeper theory that explains it?</p><br>

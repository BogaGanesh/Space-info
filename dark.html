<h2>Dark Matter</h2>
<p>Dark matter is one of the most intriguing and elusive components of the universe. It is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects. Despite its mysterious nature, dark matter is believed to make up about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, while ordinary matter (atoms) accounts for only about 5%. The rest is attributed to dark energy.</p><br>

<h3>Evidence for Dark Matter</h3>
<p>In the 1930s, astronomer Fritz Zwicky observed that galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving faster than expected based on the visible matter. This suggested the presence of additional unseen mass.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Vera Rubin and colleagues studied the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and found that stars at the edges of galaxies were orbiting much faster than predicted by the visible matter alone. This provided strong evidence for dark matter.</p>
<p>Dark matter bends light from distant objects through gravitational lensing, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general relativity.</p>
<p>Observations of lensing effects, such as the Bullet Cluster, show that the mass causing the lensing is not aligned with the visible matter, indicating the presence of dark matter.</p>
<p>The CMB, the afterglow of the Big Bang, provides a snapshot of the early universe. Measurements by missions like WMAP and Planck show that dark matter played a crucial role in the formation of large-scale structures in the universe.</p>
<p>The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe suggests that dark matter forms a "cosmic web" that guides the growth of structures over time.</p><br>

<h3>Properties of Dark Matter</h3>
<p>Dark matter is not made of protons, neutrons, or electrons (baryonic matter). Instead, it is thought to consist of exotic particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter.</p>
<p>Dark matter is classified as cold dark matter (CDM), meaning its particles move slowly compared to the speed of light. This allows it to clump together and form structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters.</p>
<p>Dark matter interacts primarily through gravity and possibly through the weak nuclear force, but not through electromagnetism or the strong nuclear force. This makes it nearly invisible.</p><br>

<h3>Candidates for Dark Matter</h3>
<p>WIMPs are hypothetical particles with masses between 10 and 1000 times that of a proton. They are a leading candidate for dark matter and are actively searched for in experiments like LUX, XENON, and DarkSide.</p>
<p>Axions are extremely light, hypothetical particles proposed to solve a problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They are also a candidate for dark matter and are being searched for in experiments like ADMX.</p>
<p>Neutrinos are known particles that interact very weakly with matter. However, they are too light and fast-moving to account for all dark matter, though they may contribute a small fraction.</p>
<p>MACHOs are objects like black holes, neutron stars, or brown dwarfs that could contribute to dark matter. However, observations suggest they cannot account for all of it.</p><br>

<h3>The Role of Dark Matter in the Universe</h3>
<p>Dark matter's gravitational pull provided the scaffolding for the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the early universe.</p>
<p>Dark matter halos surround galaxies, influencing their rotation and stability. Without dark matter, galaxies would not have enough mass to hold together at their observed speeds.</p>
<p>Dark matter forms a vast, interconnected network of filaments and voids, shaping the large-scale structure of the universe.</p><br>

<h3>Challenges and Open Questions</h3>
<p>Despite decades of research, the exact nature of dark matter remains unknown. Is it a single type of particle, or a mix of different particles?</p>
<p>No direct detection of dark matter has been confirmed, raising questions about its properties and interactions.</p>
<p>Both dark matter and dark energy dominate the universe, but their relationship (if any) is unclear.</p><br>

<h3>Future Research</h3>
<p>Upcoming experiments like LZ (LUX-ZEPLIN), DARWIN, and SuperCDMS aim to improve sensitivity to dark matter interactions.</p>
<p>Missions like Euclid and WFIRST will map the distribution of dark matter using gravitational lensing.</p>
<p>Progress in particle physics and cosmology may reveal new insights into dark matter's nature and role in the universe.</p><br>

<p>Dark matter is a cornerstone of modern cosmology, yet it remains one of the greatest mysteries in science. Its discovery and understanding could revolutionize our knowledge of the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest structures.</p>
